# Object detection with drone image dataset by detectron2 library

### âœ… detectron2 library is developed by facebook.


#### ðŸ”— detectron2 documentation: https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2
#### ðŸ“Š dataset is images taken by drone: https://bozcani.github.io/auairdataset


We used detectron2 object detection for mentioned dataset. 
First, we stored drone dataset annotations and JPEG file names in jsons in format of coco dataset.
Second, there is need to register the dataset in detectron library.
Finally, the detection algorithm can be run to get the results.

ðŸ“Œ Result of test images are at the end of code.
